    content: |-
      I earned my Master's degree in Computer Science from Seattle University. Currently seeking full-time roles in software engineering and I am open to relocation.

      Previously, I was part of IRI, a top SAAS solution provider. As an Associate Software Engineer, I took care of various tasks like collecting requirements, creating user-friendly web designs, building APIs, managing databases, and more. I'm experienced in both front-end and back-end work, and I love testing things to make sure they're working smoothly.

      I'm also familiar with setting up automated testing and deployment processes, and I'm no stranger to teamwork – I've collaborated with designers, product managers, and fellow developers to bring cool features to life. I've got a knack for explaining complex tech stuff too.

      With my mix of education and work experience, I'd be a great fit for a software development role in any organization. I'm someone who thrives in fast-paced environments and is ready to take on new challenges using my skills and expertise.
